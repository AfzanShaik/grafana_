This repository belongs to Grafana from Beginner to Advanced [](https://www.udemy.com/course/grafana-graphite-and-statsd-visualize-metrics/?referralCode=F9360D03CB430529BEAD)

The course covers the installation and usage of Grafana, Graphite, and Loki on-prem and in the cloud. It also includes integrations with various databases such as InfluxDB, MySQL, Elasticsearch, SQL Server, and Prometheus.

## Microservices for Opentelemetry

The code and binary files of Microservice(s) demonstrating how Opentelemetry signals are produced and pushed to Grafana Alloy are in /the Microservices folder (i.e., Microservices/OrderService). The code is written in C# and .NET.

You don't have to compile the code; you can download and unzip the binary files under the Microservices/releases/* folder. These binary files assume that Grafana Alloy is available locally. To change the address of Grafana Alloy, open the appSettings.json file and change the URL of Grafana Alloy there.
